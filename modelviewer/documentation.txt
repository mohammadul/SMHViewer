SMHViewer ModelViewer is an OFF/PLY/ASC/XYZ/BINv1/BundlerOUT/NVM model viewer designed by Sk. Mohammadul Haque.  
   

COMMAND-LINE SYNTAX
---
The default command-line syntax is given as follows.  
modelviewer [-f] [-c cfg_fname] file1 [file2 [file3 [...]]]  
   

PARAMETERS
---
The parameters are given as follows.  
-f opens the viewer in a fullscreen mode (optional).  
-c cfg_fname loads infra configuration (optional).  
file1 - name of the first 3D model file.  
file2, file3, ... - names of the second, third, ... 3D model files (optional).  
   

INTERACTIONS
---
There are numerous keyboard shortcuts which can be used in conjunction with the mouse.  
All the functions are given as follows.  
   
Mouse interaction
----
Left Button - rotates the model.
